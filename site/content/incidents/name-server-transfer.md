Our domain name servers are currently being moved, which may result in some disruption. This is being done overnight so as to minimize the majority of traffic coming from North America. Please allow 1-2 days for the transfer to complete. Users shouldn't notice an immediate difference, but if you run into trouble, please let us know at support@bahaistudies.ca
